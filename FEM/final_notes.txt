The process of retrieving a page goes something like:
1. Code is written in an Editor
2. Code is pushed to a server
3. User requests your URL from the server
4. Our index.html is delivered to them
5. The index.html is read line-by-line, and the corresponding CSS and JS files
	are loaded.

NOTE: The CSS is executed line by line fairly quickly. The JS script is loaded, each line in it is executed line-by-line, and 
		once it is over, the remaining HTML lines are executed.

DOM (Document Object Model):
- Things you have in the DOM are not accessible in node.js or deno or other runtimes

Assume your HTML is as follows:
	<div class="red-square"></div>

Assume CSS is as follows:
	.red-square {
		color: red;
		width: 100px;
		height: 100px;
	}

Our output would be a red square, we can overwrite this using Javascript.

const redSquare = document.querySelector(".red-square");
redSquare.style.backgroundColor = "limegreen";
redSquare.style.width = "300px";

The variable redSquare would be referring to the square created in HTML, and we can modify its appearance using JS.

The "document" keyword allows you to reach into your HTML and modify values.
When we manipulate styles, we're actually just adding inline styles.

The old way of modifying values was document.getElementsByClassName('classNameWithout.')

Note: querySelector finds the first instance of some class
	  querySelectorAll finds all the instances of some class
