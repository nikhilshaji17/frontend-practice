Plan:
1. Lay out the HTML of the page first.
2. Style the HTML
3. Apply JS functionality

HTML:
1. Focus on just placing the black display screen first. You can display block here.
2. Now, focus on creating the layout for the buttons that follow. Flex should be the way to go.
	Put all the buttons as a block.

Javascript:
1. Add an event listener to every button, that listens for clicks
2. Take the inner text of the button that was clicked
	a. If the button was any digit, display it on the screen, and store it in result.
	b. If the button was the Clear option, set displayText to 0, and set result to 0.
	c. If the button was any of the operators:
		- DisplayText must be 0
		- The value we had must be stored somewhere (in result preferably)
		- The tempResult must be reset, so as to catch the next number
